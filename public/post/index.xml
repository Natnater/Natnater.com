      <description>Prologue Just testing some markdown stuff to see how it works with Hugo. May delete this later, or may keep it as a reference.&#xA;For the record, I write my Markdown in Obsidian so I get a bit of a WYSIWYG thing going on &amp;ndash; I know the whole point of Markdown is that it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be readable on its own, but hey &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t judge me :)&#xA;One of these days I&amp;rsquo;ll learn some HTML.</description>

      <description>When designing my Time Block journal for work, I included a 4-panel &amp;ldquo;Daily Doodle&amp;rdquo; section in an attempt to reconnect with my inner child (I wanted to be a cartoonist when I was a kid). Here are my daily comics for August of 2024 (featuring a surprise guest: July 31, 2024!)&#xA;07/31/24 08/01/24 </description>

      <description>As seen in my previous post (note to self: learn how to hyperlink between pages in Hugo) I got a new camera and have been learning how to use it. The example photos in that post did not turn out super great, which is as I expected. The purpose of that photoshoot was to:&#xA;See if the camera worked at all (it does), and&#xA;See if the light meter worked (it does!</description>

      <description>Prologue Look, I&amp;rsquo;m a reasonable guy. Everyone makes mistakes &amp;ndash; myself least of all &amp;ndash; so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything in life to be perfect. Except, well&amp;hellip;&#xA;I do expect large corporations to do a couple of once-overs on their documents before they push them to the public to ensure that there are no weird linguistic or formatting errors. All I&amp;rsquo;m asking is for documents presented by any organization larger than, say, ten people, to be utterly perfect.</description>

      <description>Prologue A while back, a couple of friends from Norway visited us here stateside. I took them to a couple of thrift stores and, while shopping, one of the friends found a little Kodak Duaflex camera &amp;ndash; a very small film camera that uses Kodak 620 film (now not produced, but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole other story), features a top-down viewfinder, and creates a nice film photography vibe.&#xA;I had always considered myself an amateur photographer (and by this I mean someone who likes to do more than just take pictures with a phone, though I do quite love the cameras on my S22 Ultra &amp;ndash; main reason I bought the thing), but seeing her shoot film, and seeing the results, really tickled some part of me deep within my brain &amp;ndash; the part of me that prefers synthesizers over MIDI controllers, Computer Engineering over Computer Science, VHS over Vimeo, and (apparently) film over digital photography.</description>
