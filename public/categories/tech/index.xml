      <description>Prologue Just testing some markdown stuff to see how it works with Hugo. May delete this later, or may keep it as a reference.&#xA;For the record, I write my Markdown in Obsidian so I get a bit of a WYSIWYG thing going on &amp;ndash; I know the whole point of Markdown is that it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be readable on its own, but hey &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t judge me :)&#xA;One of these days I&amp;rsquo;ll learn some HTML.</description>

      <description>As seen in my previous post (note to self: learn how to hyperlink between pages in Hugo) I got a new camera and have been learning how to use it. The example photos in that post did not turn out super great, which is as I expected. The purpose of that photoshoot was to:&#xA;See if the camera worked at all (it does), and&#xA;See if the light meter worked (it does!</description>

      <description>Prologue A while back, a couple of friends from Norway visited us here stateside. I took them to a couple of thrift stores and, while shopping, one of the friends found a little Kodak Duaflex camera &amp;ndash; a very small film camera that uses Kodak 620 film (now not produced, but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole other story), features a top-down viewfinder, and creates a nice film photography vibe.&#xA;I had always considered myself an amateur photographer (and by this I mean someone who likes to do more than just take pictures with a phone, though I do quite love the cameras on my S22 Ultra &amp;ndash; main reason I bought the thing), but seeing her shoot film, and seeing the results, really tickled some part of me deep within my brain &amp;ndash; the part of me that prefers synthesizers over MIDI controllers, Computer Engineering over Computer Science, VHS over Vimeo, and (apparently) film over digital photography.</description>
