I took them to a couple of thrift stores and, while shopping, one of the friends found a little Kodak Duaflex camera &amp;ndash; a very small film camera that uses Kodak 620 film (now not produced, but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole other story), features a top-down viewfinder, and creates a nice film photography vibe.&#xA;I had always considered myself an amateur photographer (and by this I mean someone who likes to do more than just take pictures with a phone, though I do quite love the cameras on my S22 Ultra &amp;ndash; main reason I bought the thing), but seeing her shoot film, and seeing the results, really tickled some part of me deep within my brain &amp;ndash; the part of me that prefers synthesizers over MIDI controllers, Computer Engineering over Computer Science, VHS over Vimeo, and (apparently) film over digital photography.</description>
