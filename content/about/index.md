## About Me
**Nate Van Devender** is an electrical engineer who has not completed his "about me" section yet. 
This is probably because he is busy working at his job, working on his home, or is spending time
with his family.

He posts occasionally.  He does not expect anyone to read it.  If someone reads it, he's delighted
to hear feedback.  He does miss writing, however, so he started the blog to help him get back into it.

He used to make youtube videos a long time ago -- you can check them out at youtube.com/Natnater if you
for some reason feel inclined.
